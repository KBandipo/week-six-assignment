          You are presented with a string with a collection of data which are
          mixed alphabets i.e., "abdsgyhidsaadgbdaasbvcydsaabdgsaayre", create a
          function that will count through the string and show the number of a,
          b, d and y each contained in the string.
        </p>
        <p>
          Note: the output is expected to be a number for each of the counted
          elements.
        </p>

        <p>
          Given a string of items to be ``rice, yam, beans, cocoyam, banana,
          semo, table, tyre, milk, phone, watch, chair" use methods to separate
          the edible and non-edible items from the string.
        </p>
        <p>
          Note: your output should be two new strings, one containing edible
          items and the other non-edible items.
